# Upload Server for Elsie

### Elsie is the BoxiiiCam App

There's a Vagrant called "Doctor Crook" Find the good doctor on Solomon, in `~/dvags/drcrook`

Code working directory is, of course, `~/cod15/elsie-sinatra-server`

It's wired up to participate in my usual github push cycle -- see `~/github` on Solomon.

There is an `nginx` config that one needs to activate. On DrCrook.
